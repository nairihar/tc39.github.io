<h1>Translation Guidelines</h1>
<p>The translation of the TC39 web page aims to make the work of TC39 more accessible to people whose
native language may not be english. For this, we are working with the community to get basic
information about upcoming language features into their language.</p>
<p>As English is the default TC39 language, this document serves as a general guidance on how to do
translations.</p>
<h2>Adding a translation of a feature</h2>
<p>To translate a feature, edit the <a href="_data/en/stage3.yml">stage 3 file</a> for that language. If a
description field is empty, that proposal needs a translation. Once you finish the translation(s),
you can open a pull request and ping a reviewer who can ok your translation.</p>
<h2>Adding support for a new language</h2>
<p>To add a new language, you will need to create a couple of files. A good way to get started is to
clone the <a href="_data/en">english language directory</a> or any other language to start with. Name the folder using the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html#Canonical_Unicode_Locale_Identifiers">Unicode BCP 47</a> locale identifiers. We currently prefer language only identifiers, but can expand to regions as necessary.</p>
<p>Once you have created your folder, you will want to translate all text into your language. You will
also want to copy this readme file and translate it, so others can help you.</p>
<p>With that finished, add your language to the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml#L21">language list</a> and <a href="_data/languages.yml">language file</a> of the site. You will need a reviewer to proof read your translations, and request a review from @codehag to make sure everything looks right.</p>
